                <ol>
                  <li>Online schooling is safe and reliable.</li>
                  <li>Our curriculum and teachers are excellent.</li>
                </ol>

              <li>3:40 - 5:45 Family Portal: The Dashboard
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>The Dashboard allows you to quickly monitor grades, read
                  important messages, review the time spent in school, and
                  monitor progress in classes.</li>
                  <li>The Academic Snapshot can tell you the number of
                  assignments that a studnet has completed in a specific class,
                  their current class grade based on the assignments that the
                  student has completed, and review their pacing. It is
                  important to pay attention to the student's overall grade,
                  too.</li>
                </ol>

              <li>5:46 - 7:00 Th eLearning Management System: Buzz
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Each class has a course card. Click into the course card
                  to access the lessons. You can also find more details about
                  the student's grade and pacing.</li>
                  <li>Our classes have dynamic pacing, which means that if your
                  child misses a day of school, the student's lessons are moved
                  to th next day. Th system keeps track of what you child needs
                  to complete in order to finish on time.</li>
                  <li>The system is user-friendly, and K-5 classes include
                  lessons about navigating the plaform and middle and high
                  school students have an Orientation class to review this
                  information.</li>

              <li>7:00 - 9:12 Online School Materials and Attendance
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Kindergarten through 5th grade students will receive
                  paper materials, like workbooks. Sixth through twelfth grade
                  students will have most of their materials online, and it is
                  important to review the school supplies for each course in
                  case you need general household items for a science lab or
                  other activity.</li>
                  <li>It's a good idea to have general school supplies
                  available, like notebooks, pens, and pencils.</li>
                  <li>Attendance logs are on your student's dashboard, and
                  should be completed each Monday. The form will be
                  pre-populated, and you click save.</li>
                  <li>Classes will become available once your child's
                  attendance is completed.</li>

                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Some assignments will have to be submitted as PDFs, and
                  it is very important to download the PDF first. It can be
                  tempting to type directly into the PDF, but your child's work
                  will not save.</li>
                  <li>Elementary students with workbooks can submit their work
                  by taking pictures of the page and sending the image to the
                  teacher.</li>
                </ol>

                  electives list, which you can find at astravo.org by
                  scrolling all the way to the bottom of the page.</li>
                  <li>Orientation is built into K-5 courses and 6-12 have an
                  Orientation course that can be found on the Academic Snapshot
                  box.</li>

              <li>16:21 - 20:36 Where you should start
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Login using the credentials that were emailed to you. You
                  will not be able to access lessons unless you use your
                  school-created Google account.</li>
                  <li>Look at the Dashboard to check your schedule. Your child
                  can add or drop classes 15 days from the start of school
                  without penalty.</li>
                  <li>Complete Orientation! You’ll learn about how to go
                  through your classes, what to expect with grading, and
                  information on how to submit assignments.</li>
                  <li>Take the i-Ready reading and math assessments. They are
                  listed on the Academic Snapshot as classes. Your child will
                  take the assessments three times a year, and they tell us a
                  lot about your child as a learner in terms of how they’re
                  doing in reading and math, and if we need to provide
                  additional support.</li>
                  <li>i-Ready also includes lessons that are geared towards
                  what your child needs. For example, if your child is
                  struggling with math, the program will give them math lessons
                  that are tailored to their specific needs.</li>
                  <li>We recommend that students spend about 30-45 minutes a
                  day on i-Ready. i-Ready is adaptive, meaning that if your
                  child is doing well in reading or math, then the assessments
                  will become more challenging. Your child can take the
                  assessment in multiple settings, and any progress will be
                  lost if the i-Ready assessment is not completed in 40
                  days.</li>
                  <li>You can quickly email your teachers using the airplane
                  icon or through google hangouts.</li>

                  phone number if friends or family have questions about our
                  program. They can also contact us at <a href=
